## Overview

This API calculates reward points for customers based on their transaction amounts. The points are awarded according to the following logic:

- For purchases over **$100**, customers earn **2 points per dollar** for the amount over $100.
- For purchases between **$50 and $100**, customers earn **1 point per dollar** for the amount between $50 and $100.

Example Calculation

For a $120 purchase:
- **$20** over $100 earns **2 points per dollar**: `2 * $20 = 40 points`.
- **$50** between $50 and $100 earns **1 point per dollar**: `1 * $50 = 50 points`.

Total reward points: **90 points**.

## Architecture

The API is structured in a layered architecture:

- **Controller Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP request and provides appropriate responses.
- **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic to calculate reward points.
- **Repository Layer**: Manages the storage of transaction records.
- **POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects)**: Data models for customers and their transactions.
- **Global Exception Handler**: Catches and returns consistent error messages.

## Technologies

The following technologies are used to implement the API:

- **Java**: The primary programming language used to implement the business logic.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to build the RESTful API.
- **JUnit**: Used for unit testing.
- **H2 Database**: An in-memory database used to store transaction records and calculate points.
- **Postman**: Tool used for testing the API endpoints.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool.
